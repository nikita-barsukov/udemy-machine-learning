# Machine Learning A-Z

Code and excercises for a course on Udemy:
Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

# General notes

Code does not follow course verbatim. It is more verbose, there is more console output, more plots, more everything. It also has extra coding tasks. usually they are about using a different dataset and applying machine learning algorithm to this dataset.

I also try to comment code as detailed as possible, at the same time keeping comments meaningful.

## Technical requirements

Operating system: Windows 10. Should work on other operating systems with possible minor tweaks.

R scripts: 

1. Microsoft R Open or vanilla R
2. RStudio, likely to throw errors when launched in console.

Python files:

1. Python 3.6+ (Anaconda or vanilla)
2. Visual Studio Code
